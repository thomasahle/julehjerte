# Generator robustness results

Offline audit completed 15 October 2026. Baseline: `7e5d5d7`. The generators are safer and cover more inputs after this change, but **they do not yet support every tested combination**. Refusals are listed separately from successful generations.

| Corpus | Configurations | Accepted | Refused | Invalid accepted output |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Text: 34 inputs, six fonts | 810 | 608 | 202 | 0 |
| Figures: 51 motifs, 22 templates | 1122 | 883 | 239 | 0 |

All accepted results passed contour fidelity and cut validation, then JSON and SVG save/reload checks. There were **no regressions among previously accepted configurations**. These are digital checks; no physical weaving trial was performed.

## Comparison on the original 1,884 configurations

The extra `amy` and uneven multiline `A\nnnn` cases were added later and are excluded from this before/after comparison.

| Mode | Before | After | Newly accepted |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Text | 526/762 | 565/762 | 39 |
| Figure | 880/1122 | 883/1122 | 3 |

## What changed

- Sharp concave letter shoulders can use an invisible chord through the filled stroke. It preserves the complete outline, uses no cutouts, and must retain the four open path pairings. Boundary-cap routes are checked separately so a bridge cannot remove part of a letter.
- Difficult text gets an additional layout with more spacing and separate lanes along flat frame sides. The font and selected frame stay the same.
- Figure fallback constructions can distribute details over larger panel grids. The gift now works in all three oval templates, using a 6×6 grid.
- Exterior spokes are checked once per attachment, before trying counter bridges. Extra chord attempts are bounded; the air layout no longer repeats an identical failed construction.
- The seasonal catalog no longer labels an archery bow as a ribbon bow; it shows a gift in its place.
- The corpus distinguishes construction refusals, unexpected runtime errors, invalid accepted output, and regressions. It pins accepted configurations so future failures cannot disappear inside an aggregate pass count.

## Text coverage by font

Nunito uses all nine frames. The other fonts use woven, air and repeat. The ten-letter repeat limit excludes one input per font.

## Remaining limitations

- Repeated text still refuses some dotted/accented letters and mixed-case words, including Nunito `jul`, `Sofie`, `ÆØÅ` and `Anna`. The extra boundary components and their connections need a more general construction.
- Fine handwriting and serif strokes still fail spacing checks in many combinations. Some failed cases remain slow; measured times are diagnostics, not a latency guarantee.
- Some complex or thin figures remain unavailable, including the authored `snow`, `ph-butterfly`, `ph-rabbit`, `ph-bicycle`, `ph-sun` and `tb-paw` motifs. Other figures work in only some frames.
- Invalid constructions remain unavailable for export. Tests do not waive clearance, remove counters, replace fonts or redraw the source motif to raise the success rate.

## Reproduce

See [the harness instructions](README.md). Run `npm run test:generator:robustness` for the full matrix. Per-case results go to `tmp/generator/report.json`, with timings, failure reasons and strip counts. The ordinary test suite includes 35 focused generation/export regressions.

Browser verification covered the repaired Nunito `anna` repeat preview and its 8×4-strip editor handoff. The gift’s oval pattern and all 42 motifs accepted in the default circle-rays frame were inspected as rendered SVG contact sheets. This checks recognizability, not physical weaveability.
